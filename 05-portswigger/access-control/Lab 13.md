### Referer-based access control

Some websites base access controls on the `Referer` header submitted in the HTTP request. The `Referer` header can be added to requests by browsers to indicate which page initiated a request.

For example, an application robustly enforces access control over the main administrative page at `/admin`, but for sub-pages such as `/admin/deleteUser` only inspects the `Referer` header. If the `Referer` header contains the main `/admin` URL, then the request is allowed.

In this case, the `Referer` header can be fully controlled by an attacker. This means that they can forge direct requests to sensitive sub-pages by supplying the required `Referer` header, and gain unauthorized access.
